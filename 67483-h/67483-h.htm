<h2>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE author is gratified at the cordial
reception which the first edition of his
work has met with. The issue of a
second edition has given the opportunity of
making some minor corrections, and of including
in the closing paragraphs an appreciative
reference to the work of the American
Bible Society.</p>

<p>Contemplation of the published work has
suggested to the author that greater significance
might have been attributed to the background
and environment of Tindale's early
manhood. The breaking up of the social and
religious structure of his time, and the spread
of the New Learning over Western Europe
were events profoundly affecting the character
and career of contemporary English
youth. Thus, the disintegration and dissolution
of the overawing authority of the Church,
though she retained for decades sufficient
power to strike down her foes; the splintered
social unity which resulted from the decadence
of the Feudal Order, with class suspicion
and hatred ensuing, combined to throw
men off their moral balance: and then into
this moral confusion came rumours of literatures,
unknown and ancient, which opened
to the startled minds of teachers and students
knowledge that at once widened and made
more wondrous the world which men thought
they knew. The discovery of the Greek and
Latin literatures excited the imaginations of
the younger men. Oxford and Cambridge
students in groups crossed the English Channel
and enrolled themselves in the Continental
Universities that they might gain at first
hand the knowledge they desired. Grocyn,
Linacre, and Colet came back eager to teach
and guide. But most significant of all was
this, that Erasmus landed in England.</p>

<p>Romantic stories were in the air of a New
World beyond the seas.</p>

<p>Now the reaction of all this on the nation
at large was a disquietude and disturbance
that led confusion towards fear and panic.</p>

<p>Such was the atmosphere which as a youth
Tindale breathed. Not the least of his claims
to greatness are his deep insight into that
disturbance of the national soul, and the adventurous
confidence with which he entered
on that long self-discipline which fitted him
for the enterprise he so brilliantly fulfilled.</p>

<p>When four hundred years ago the Low
Countries of Europe, Holland and Belgium,
passed by inheritance to the reigning Spanish
Sovereign, Charles I, these lands became
the theatre of long and devastating warfare.
Siege and sally, slaughter and suffering
brought misery on the people like a flood.</p>

<p>Yet it was in that distracted country, amid
suffering almost universal, that there came
into being the unrivalled sweetness of belfry
music. Singing towers all over the Netherlands
sprang into the air. Carillons by the
score were hung, and have been the delight
and pride of the people for a dozen generations
or more.</p>

<p>To much the same effect, we may say, out
of the disquietude and suffering of those
early years of the Sixteenth Century there
came in our English tongue a work which has
proved to be "the most majestical thing in
our literature, the most living spiritual thing
in our tradition"; and we owe it to this high-hearted
Apostle of our Faith, William
Tindale.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">April</span>, 1925.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH the approach of the Fourth
Centenary there is a demand for a
memoir of Tindale, less detailed
than the standard biography, yet preserving
the perspective of history. To meet this
demand this miniature has been prepared. It
sets forth especially the ardent force of
vision which sustained the exile in the depth
and tumult of his toil.</p>

<p>Diligent use has been made of recognized
authorities on the subject treated; and it is
hoped the little volume may make room for
itself in this busy age. For helpful suggestions,
the author is indebted to Mr. A. M.
Denovan and Mr. B. R. Brooker; and to the
Religious Tract Society for kind permission
to reproduce illustrations from their standard
Biography of Tindale.</p>

<p>It is offered to the public under the
tolerant aphorism: "So long as a man says
sincerely what he thinks, he tells us something
worth while."</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">"THE first scholar and the first divine
of his epoch"—the words stand
true of William Tindale; but his
personality is even more arresting, for only
a man richly endowed with courage, sincerity,
uprightness, the sense of duty and the love
of country, could have served England so
nobly as he did: yet England knows not the
man.</p>

<p>Fifteen years, or sixteen at most, early in
the Sixteenth Century, 1520-1536, enclose
the immemorial labors of William Tindale.
During that decade and a half there were for
him experiences and enterprises which went
to the making of the man, and show what
manner of man he was: but which also set
him forth as one of the greatest of his race.</p>

<p>Formative years preceded these; some
thirty of them one conjectures; of which,
however, we can discover little. We get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span>
glimpses of him and his doings; but they are
like flashes of lightning in a dark sky. A
narrative of this man's life would seem forever
impossible: what letters there were, or
other documents, disappeared long ago: and
the path he trod with unfaltering step we
can trace in patches only.</p>

<p>For all that it is possible to set out the
features of the man, realize the massive
qualities he possessed, recall his surroundings,
the atmosphere he breathed, the
hostility he aroused, the victory he won at the
cost of his life; and so to recognize the valor,
the magnanimity, and in a word the greatness
of this too little known English worthy.</p>

<p>A biographic blank like this, where incidents
of consequence must have transpired,
is not altogether unknown in history.</p>

<p>History encounters the same difficulty in
the life of Wyclif. The character of his
parents is unknown. Not an anecdote of his
boyhood remains. His life at Oxford, extending
over forty years, yields but a single
incident.</p>

<p>In one of Tindale's younger contemporaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">{xix}</a></span>
in the northern kingdom, there occurs
a similar desert stretch, where the silence is
even more profound; and which the most
diligent research has failed to break. John
Knox was born in 1505; and of his inner life
for the first forty years we know absolutely
nothing. Then suddenly, against a background
darker in Scotland than that in England,
he emerges holding George Wishart's
two-edged sword in his hand.</p>

<p>Of the crisis which lay behind, which
changed him from a priest before the altar to
the beloved disciple of this early martyr, we
hear not a word. "In the solemn days of
early faith", wrote the late Taylor Innes,
"not a few men like him were in the desert
until the time of their showing unto Israel.
Not the polished shaft only, but the rough
spear-head too was in the shadow of a
mighty hand until the day when it was
launched."</p>

<p>If ever Papini's paradoxical dictum be
credible, it is in a life like this: "The most
highly educational biographies are those of
men of whom little or nothing is known.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">{xx}</a></span>
Those are the books that set forth the
human ideal, that tell us what a man ought
to be." The paradox is elsewhere resolved
by him when he says: "I care less for the
whole course of a man's life than for his own
distilling of its essence."</p>

<p>The distilled essence of Tindale's life
comes to view again and again during these
brief years; which were crowded with events,
dramatic and of age-long significance, and
which passed from drama to tragedy in the
martyr fires he had long foreseen.</p>

<p>Centenaries are apt to miscarry. If such
occasions serve only for the display of
erudition and platform vanity, and fail to
lead us to seek the essential message and the
continuing inspiration of the great men they
celebrate, what riches of the past remain
sealed to us! There have been celebrations
loudly acclaimed by men who would have
bayed at the heels of the brave revolutionary
whom they now eloquently praise. They
simulate seeing he is no longer alive and
dangerous, but a hero dead: and they join
the chorus of universal praise. The effect is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">{xxi}</a></span>
to emphasize the deadness of the past, not to
rekindle glorious life—this is rekindled only
where there is eagerness to be in or near the
succession of the great, where there is
sympathy with admiration, where there is in
fine some kinship of spirit.</p>

<p>The true aim of Centennials is more
psychological than historical. Not so much
the magnification of the subject as the discovery
of what was his lofty purpose, his high
endurance, his nobility of spirit: not even his
success, but his endeavor; and this in order
that in our admiration we may draw inspiration
for ourselves and emulate his spirit in
the altered circumstances of the time. That
resolve to recapture for the world of to-day
a courage and a consecration of which the
world of his day was contemptuous, and to
devote these invaluable virtues to the opportunities
of our time—that is the soul-stirring
aim in revivifying the past; and is
not that the true heritage of all the ages?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
CONDITIONS IN ENGLAND</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CAN we picture to ourselves the world
in which Tindale gradually came into
public view, made his voice heard in
palaces, manor houses and homes of the
common people; making enemies rage, but
winning friends innumerable, until finally a
price was set on his head: and there were
Englishmen eager to entrap him to his death?</p>

<p>What was the condition of England then?
What figures stand out conspicuous in the
life of the nation? In whose hands did administrative
power lie? In what directions
were events moving? In the forefront of the
nation strode Wolsey, clothed with power,
dominating every avenue of corporate action,
the master of church and state, and irresistible
so long as he could retain the indulgence
of the king. It was the time when Wolsey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
had succeeded in substituting royal despotism
for quasi-representative government, and
had himself risen to giddy heights of power
and affluence, only to fall headlong in infamy
and remorse. His sovereign had at length
turned with Tudor frenzy against his minister.
The king's marriage projects, his
impatience with the Cardinal's vanity, as
extravagant as it was grotesque, were
not the only cause for dishonor; the King
had purposes which called for servants of
another type, and Henry was resolved to
wield the royal power alone.</p>

<div class="image-center">

  <div class="caption">
    <p>DESIDERIUS ERASMUS.<br />
       After Albert Durer.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Erasmus, More and Colet were the men of
letters conspicuous in ability and influence
during Tindale's boyhood. The three men
were in intimate sympathy with one another;
and each in his own fashion, exponents of
the new learning, gave the country whole-hearted
service. All were men of outstanding
talent, and labored unceasingly for the
ends they had in view. Colet was the
preacher of renown. His University lectures
on St. Paul's Epistles were scarcely less
notable than his sermons in London. Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
Thomas More was witty, intense, versatile,
broad-minded, gifted with imagination and
courage; but when he encountered the
violence of Luther suddenly changed to the
recusancy of the bigots and the bishops.
Erasmus, the greatest of the three, never
altered his plans. He held on his way alike
in all weathers undeterred, enlightening his
time with the treasures he had found in the
New Testament. It was in the year 1516 he
issued his Greek Testament, with a Latin
version alongside, correcting errors in the
Vulgate; and that issue was a landmark in
the history of the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>These three men incensed the conservatism
of the Church. They refused to shut their
eyes to the prevalent ignorance and unworthiness
of the priesthood. They laid bare the
open sores in the body ecclesiastic. Their
irony and satire played about abbots, bishops
and curés; but in all the castigation inflicted,
there was no sign given by the priesthood of
change or desire for reformation; only
rancour and rage. As the truth got utterance
given to it, the people took sides slowly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
the tides of feeling rose and spread. Listen
to one voice from the multitude:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>Gloucestershire was a stronghold of the
Church. The proverb "As sure as God is in
Gloucester" gave point to it. Only a few of
the clergy understood the Latin services they
read or sang. None of them knew the contents
of the Bible; and many were outspoken
in their disparagement of it. When argument
arose and some rare voice made reference
to the Bible, they thought to silence
him by saying the Pope, or this or that, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
above the Bible. It was in the course of
conversation and debate that a certain man
ejaculated to Tindale "We were better be
without God's laws than the Pope's". The
attitude is the more to be remarked because
as a consequence of the new learning there
had been a wide diffusion of the Bible in the
Latin language (the Vulgate) since the invention
of printing. No fewer than eighty
editions, although one cannot ascertain what
was the size of the editions, had been issued
between 1462 and 1500.</p>

<p>As a sign of the times, this diffusion of
the Latin Bible was curiously significant.
Significant it was indeed in more ways than
one. It showed (1) that the scholars of the
church were being influenced by the new
learning; but also (2) that a strict reservation
was to be enforced in confining it to
scholars. The Bible was for scholars, not for
others. A fine instance is in the case of the
Complutensian Polyglot. Complutum was
the Latin name of Alcala. In 1502 Cardinal
Ximenes, the founder of Alcala University,
decided on the issue of a Polyglot edition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
the Bible wherein the Vulgate should be
placed alongside of the best Hebrew and
the best Greek manuscripts. "Every theologian",
he said, "should also be able to
drink of that water which springeth up to
eternal life at the fountain head itself....
Our object is to revive the hitherto dormant
study of the Sacred Scriptures". The very
men who thus engaged in the publication of
the Bible, denounced with the direst of
penalties its distribution outside the charmed
circle of the learned.</p>

<p>Freedom of conscience there was none.
Tolerance was proclaimed as an emanation
of Hell. Difference of opinion was deadly.
To acknowledge misgiving or doubt or dissent
was incontinently to be rated as a rebel
and exposed to the truculency of a pitiless
hierarchy.</p>

<p>There is a companion picture of the English
world at that time, lurid and indeed
sickening. The bishops sank their humanity
in frenzied partisanship, gave rein to cruel
and monstrous passion, aided and abetted
therein by More as Lord Chancellor. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
lit the fires of Smithfield, and the spectacle
of Englishmen perishing at the stake for
honesty of thought and sincerity of life, became
so familiar as to case-harden the people
at the scenes. One story, typical of scores of
others, may be given.</p>

<p>The story has reference to Bainham's
execution: "Among the lay officials present
at the stake, was 'one Pavier', town clerk
of London. This Pavier was a Catholic
fanatic, and as the flames were about to be
kindled he burst out into violent and abusive
language. The fire blazed up, and the dying
sufferer, as the red flickering tongues licked
the flesh from off his bones, turned to him
and said, 'May God forgive thee and shew
more mercy than thou, angry reviler, shewest
to me.' The scene was soon over: the town
clerk went home. A week after, one morning
when his wife had gone to mass, he sent all
his servants out of the house on one pretext
or another, a single girl only being left, and
he withdrew to a garret at the top of the
house, which he used as an oratory. A large
crucifix was on the wall; and the girl, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
some question to ask, went to the room, and
found him standing before it, 'bitterly weeping'.
He told her to take his sword, which
was rusty, and clean it. She went away and
left him; when she returned, a little time
after, he was hanging from a beam, dead.
He was a singular person. Edward Hall, the
historian, knew him, and had heard him say,
that, 'if the king put forth the New Testament
in English, he would not live to bear it.'
And yet he could not bear to see a heretic
die. What was it? Had the meaning of
that awful figure hanging on the torturing
cross suddenly revealed itself? Had some
inner voice asked him whether, in the prayer
for his persecutors with which Christ had
parted out of life, there might be some
affinity with words which had lately sounded
in his own ears? God, into whose hands
he threw himself, self-condemned in his
wretchedness, only knows the agony of
that hour. Let the secret rest where it lies,
and let us be thankful for ourselves that we
live in a changed world."</p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right1">(<i>Froude, Henry VIII.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
When the mind pauses to reflect on this
doing to death of men because their faith did
not square with that of those in high places,
and succeeds in freeing itself from the
numbing influence which its very familiarity
causes, the amazement and horror of the
practice help us to measure the criminal folly
of it. One must make an effort indeed to
shake off that deadening influence; and then,
and only then, the arrogance and impiety of
claiming injustice, torture, judicial murder,
as a service to God, make one shudder as at
blasphemy. Yet what awful pages of history
in every part of Christendom record the
deeds of this sanguinary orthodoxy. How
hard has mankind found it to learn that
persuasion and forbearance are the real
solvents of dissent; for the faith in force is
hardly shaken to this day. Forcible suppression
is in high favor still. It may not,
dare not, perhaps, work by the same crude
and sanguinary tools, although the disclosures
of the Great War, or of Soviet
Russia, may give the lie to that caveat: but
little observation is needed to show how in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
subtler forms, alike in politics and in religion,
there is the same impatience with disagreeing
opinion, and the same self-assurance that
does not hesitate to silence a disputant by
death or shame. Wherever it lifts its head,
it is the head of Anti-Christ.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
THE MAKING OF TINDALE</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN such an atmosphere the formative years
of Tindale's life were spent. So much
can be said: but little more than that is
known with any certainty. Indeed the story
of his youth can be put in a single paragraph.
He was a native of Gloucestershire. He was
sent very young to Oxford. There he entered
Magdalen Hall, attached to Magdalen College,
the College of Wolsey and Lily. After
graduation he went for a period to Cambridge,
attracted there probably by Erasmus,
who had occupied the Greek chair.</p>

<p>It was about the time when Erasmus gave
his Greek Testament to the world. He was
fulfilling his own daring ideal, very daring
in those days. "I totally dissent", Erasmus
said in his Exhortation, "from those who are
unwilling that the Sacred Scriptures, translated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
into the vulgar tongue, should be read
by private individuals, as if Christ had
taught such subtle doctrines that they can
with difficulty be understood by a very few
theologians or as if the strength of the
Christian religion lay in men's ignorance of
it. The mysteries of kings it were perhaps
better to conceal, but Christ wishes His
mysteries to be published as widely as possible.
I would wish even all women to read
the Gospel and the Epistles of St. Paul. And
I wish they were translated into all languages
of all people, that they might be read and
known, not merely by the Scotch and the
Irish, but even by the Turks and the Saracens.
I wish that the husbandman may sing
parts of them at his plough, that the weaver
may warble them at his shuttle, that the
traveller may with their narratives beguile
the weariness of the way."</p>

<p>The very centre of the excitement it
created was in Cambridge when Tindale enrolled.
Many minds hungrily devoured the
work. The story of Bilney, "Little Bilney"
as he was affectionately called, (captivated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
by the Greek Testament, a fervent disciple of
the Gospel, intimidated by the terrors of the
persecutor, on recantation set free, and to his
honor recovering himself and courageously
confessing his new faith with martyrdom
before his eyes, he gave his life as a brave
man should) indicated what happened to
many others.</p>

<p>To no Cambridge student of the time had
the book come more opportunely and more
appropriately than to the ex-Oxford student,
whose classical attainments fitted him to
take from it the very fullest advantage. One
of Tindale's sayings amid these surroundings
was, "he had perceived by experience how
that it was impossible to establish the lay
people in any truth unless the Scriptures
were plainly laid before their eyes in the
mother tongue, that they see the process, the
order, and the meaning of the text: which
things only", he says, "moved me to translate
the New Testament."</p>

<p>Known in both colleges as an able scholar,
excelling in languages, Tindale left Cambridge
and became Chaplain-Tutor in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
family of Sir John Walsh in his native
county. There he continued his studies,
preached frequently, and met on equal terms
with the Society of the shire.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
AT LITTLE SODBURY</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CHURCHMEN and gentry were frequent
guests at the hospitable board.
The topics agitating men's minds
were often mentioned. Sometimes the conversation
waxed warm. The chaplain rarely
spoke, though nothing escaped his attention.
It was impossible always to forbear. A
question or a reflection was at times enough
to draw opposition. Indeed the relevancy
and significance of his words challenged his
listener.</p>

<p>Tindale felt himself alone. He was not
sure of the sympathies of his host: his
hostess thought him presumptuous in holding
his opinion against the company. The
atmosphere was often unfriendly.</p>

<p>In Foxe's "Acts and Monuments" we have
recorded the testimony of one who probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
got the facts from Tindale himself. Describing
such table talk, he adds: "Wherein
as those men and Master Tindale did vary in
opinions and judgments, then Master Tindale
would shew them on the book the places by
open and manifest Scripture; the which continued
for a certain season divers and sundry
times, until in the continuance thereof those
great beneficed doctors waxed weary and bore
a secret grudge in their hearts against
Master Tindale".</p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right1">(Demaus' "Life of Tindale" page 67.)</div>
</div>

<p>It was in the course of a conversation of
the kind that Tindale drove one of those
learned men to exclaim that the Pope's laws
were above all other authority; to which came
Tindale's reply, impetuous and defiant: "I
defy the Pope and his laws. If God spare my
life, ere many years I shall cause a boy that
driveth the plow shall know more of the
Scriptures than thou doest." (page 86 ib.)</p>

<p>Students of that age have been struck by
the co-incidence of this anticipation of Tindale's
and the prediction of Erasmus in the
passage where the latter records his emphatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
dissent from those who were unwilling to
have the Scriptures translated into the vulgar
tongue and read by private individuals.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:7.5em">*****</p>

<p>The coincidence is a striking one. It may
well be that the daring of the Dutch man of
letters smote a responsive chord in the
breast of the brave Englishman. If the
younger catches the torch from the hand of
his precursor, must we disparage the courage
with which the torch is carried forward and
kept ablaze?</p>

<p>From Foxe again we take the picture of
a little domestic scene, very realistic, wherein
the lady of the house occupies the centre.
"So upon a time some of those beneficed
doctors had Master Walsh and the lady his
wife, at a supper or banquet, there having
among them talk at will without any gainsaying:
and the supper or banquet being
done, and Master Walsh and the lady his wife
come home, they called for Master Tindale,
and talked with him of such communication
as had been, where they come fro (from),
and of their opinions. Master Tindale there-unto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
made answer agreeable to the truth of
God's word, and in reproving of their false
opinions. The Lady Walsh, being a stout
woman, and as Master Tindale did report her
to be wise, being there no more but they
three, Master Walsh, his wife and Master
Tindale; 'Well,' said she, 'there was such
a doctor, he may dispend (spend) two
hundred pounds by the year, another one
hundred pound, and another three hundred
pound; and what think ye, were it reason that
we should believe you before them so great,
learned and beneficed men?' Master Tindale,
hearing her, gave her no answer; nor
after that had but small arguments against
such, for he perceived it would not help in
effect to the contrary."</p>

<p>Tindale had the good sense to know
how vain would be argument with his disputant.
He found another way. Ere long
both Sir John and his lady took their stand
firmly by his side.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
IN LONDON</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TINDALE'S residence at Little Sodbury
ended when he saw that his remaining
there must bring trouble upon
the inmates of the Manor House. He resolved
to move to London, and hoped that he
might be enabled there to accomplish the task
he had set himself as his life work. His
hopes were centred on the then Bishop of
London. Tunstal was a friend of the new
learning. He was able, ambitious, liberal,
and a Prelate of rising power. If he gave his
countenance to Tindale's enterprise, its completion
and publication were assured.</p>

<p>Even with introductions it was not easy to
gain an audience. An unknown university
man was easily overlooked by this busy man
of the world. At length, however, an interview
took place. It was constrained. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
polished ecclesiastic was frigid and reserved.
He did nothing to put his visitor at ease.
Tindale's request for Episcopal countenance
received no encouragement.</p>

<p>That interview was one of the great moments
of history nevertheless. It proved a
turning point in the life of the ardent student.
It might have been the dawn of a splendid
era in the history of England.</p>

<p>His failure with the Prelate, however, was
really his good fortune. It strengthened for
him the friendship of one of the most notable
men in London. Mr. Humphrey Monmouth
was a wealthy wool merchant, an alderman of
the city, of liberal mind and cultured taste
and generous disposition. An extensive
traveller, personally acquainted with parts of
the world rarely visited at that time, and
having business connections with many lands,
he enriched the scholar by a friendship that
was beyond price. Tindale became a member
of the merchant's family for six months,
enjoyed the varied intercourse which the
hospitable table of the house afforded, and
pursued his studies with characteristic industry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
It is very probable that his host's
knowledge and acquaintance with the continental
countries, and particularly with the
Low Countries, helped to determine Tindale's
departure from London when it seemed plain
that there was no place in all England where
he could be sure he could carry out the great
work his heart was set on doing.</p>

<p>This friendship brought down upon Monmouth
the wrath of the authorities. He was
thrown into the Tower. To obtain his release
he made an appeal to Wolsey. That
appeal has been preserved. In simple matter
of fact terms it narrates his intercourse with
his whilom guest. It enables us to see the
reformer through another's eyes. "I heard
(Tindale) preach," he writes, "two or three
sermons in St. Dunstan's in the West in London,
and after that I chanced to meet him,
and with communication I learned what living
he had. He said he had none at all, but he
trusted to be with My Lord of London in his
service; and therefore I had the better
fantasy (fancy) to him. Afterward (when
this hope failed him) he came to me again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
and besought me to help him; and so I took
him into my household and there he lived
like a good priest as methought. He studied
most part of the day and the night at his
book; and he would eat but sodden meat by
his good will, nor drink but small single beer.
I never saw him wear linen about him in the
space he was with me. I did promise him
ten pounds sterling to pray for my father and
mother their souls and all Christian souls. I
did pay him when he made his exchange to
Hamburg."</p>

<p>We are to remember that in 1384, a hundred
and fifty years before the time of which
we are speaking, Wyclif had translated the
Bible into English. It was not until 1477
that the invention of printing was introduced
into England: but manuscript copies were
made in considerable numbers. There were
many willing copyists. Nearly two hundred
copies survived in the middle of the Nineteenth
Century. Yet in Tindale's time there
is not a sign that any such translation was in
existence. Many English people must have
had them in possession; but contemporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
life and records rarely show a trace of them,
or of any readers turning over their pages
in secret.</p>

<p>So complete had been the reaction from the
joys of first possession; so complete had been
the success of the prelates' policy in silencing
the Lollard preaching, and in putting out of
sight their Bible in the mother tongue.</p>

<p>It is almost certain that Tindale had a copy
of Wyclif's version: if so, it is certain he
would use it for comparison, as he used every
text within his reach. Some have overstated
this debt to Wyclif. Tindale's own words
are emphatic, that his translation is his own.
There was no version he could take as model.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
IN EXILE; (1) INTERCOURSE WITH LUTHER</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EXILE by force of circumstance is a
sorrow many have endured. To the
ardent patriot who sees with far-seeing
eye his country's destiny, and who
feels he could and will make some contribution
to the general good, it is an endless
sorrow. Tindale's intense love of country,
his high fortitude in the mission he had accepted
for himself, his clear vision of the
blessing to England the Bible in the native
tongue must bring, the unintelligent opposition
and hostility obstructing and thwarting
his work, in the end menacing his life, made
existence for him a prolonged martyrdom.
The pathos of his last words echoes all that
he endured: "Lord open the King of England's
eyes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
Tindale and Luther were contemporaries.
Their resemblances were as pronounced as
their contrasts. Both were apostles of the
Word of God. Their own discoveries of its
experimental power made reserve or silence
impossible. Of their native speech they had
so perfect a mastery that it is not too much
to say of each of them that their translations
were the moulds which determined the ultimate
development of their native tongues; and
each felt so powerfully the vital value of the
revelation as to stamp their translations
indelibly with the fire of their own faith.
Life-blood flowed in their versions. It was
the surge of this personal emotion in their
versions which made them the possession not
merely of their own generations, but of the
four centuries that have followed.</p>

<p>They differed in manner more than in
spirit or in purpose. There was a violence in
Luther uncontrolled, whose outbursts gave
such mortal offence to Sir Thomas More as
to swing him from his humanistic broad-mindedness
to a spirit of intolerance hardly
less fiery than Luther's violence. Fires probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
of equal intensity burned in Tindale: he
could say things that scarified—many of his
"pestilent glosses" stung and burned beyond
endurance; but Tindale was always master of
his powers.</p>

<p>Controversy in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth
Centuries was carried on in language
laden with poison. The fumes of it got into
the heads of all protagonists, the noblest not
excepted. Humor, the best of antidotes, did
not completely save Erasmus from its venom.
The ink of Luther's pen often spluttered with
it. Tindale himself was not immune. In
some of his glosses there are phrases that
burn and blister.</p>

<p>The reader of these modern times cannot
help feeling that this flaws noble character;
but judgment cannot overlook the manner of
the times, nor demand that Tindale be unaffected
by a malady that was then everywhere
endemic.</p>

<p>The tempestuous soul of the German could
not fail to influence the more phlegmatic
Englishman. Traces of Luther's influence
abound in Tindale's work; but have never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
overlain the independence and original
energy of the latter. It is one of the great
merits of the English reformer, that, man of
original power as he was, he laid under contribution
all available knowledge and experience
in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, German,
Spanish, Italian, in determining what his own
translation must be.</p>

<p>That these outstanding reformers met together,
more than once, is duly recorded; but
descriptive account of their intercourse there
is none. So far as their history is concerned,
they are to us like "Ships that pass in the
night." They speak one another and pass in
the dark.</p>

<p>If we could recover their table talk, we
should prize it, not only for its own sake, but
for the revelation it must make of both men.
One wonders whether it was to Tindale that
Luther, realizing sadly how each of them had
been forced by circumstances to do his work
in lonely peril, declared "Interpreters and
translators should not work alone, for good
et propria verba do not always occur to one
mind:"—or again: "My counsel is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
we draw water from the true source and
fountain, that is, that we diligently search the
Scriptures ... one single verse, one sentence
of the text, is of far more instruction
than a whole host of glosses and commentaries,
which are neither strongly penetrating
nor armour of proof."</p>

<p>Luther's country had proved a safe asylum
for the English translator. Cochlaeus was
one of many of their enemies in common; but
his battery had been unmasked. The friends
surely drew together as they found themselves
facing similar dangers day by day, and
both of them rode on those tossing seas confidently
anchored in the promises of God.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
IN EXILE: (2) TRANSLATING THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TINDALE'S life upon the Continent of
Europe can be traced in no more than
broken outline. Gaps of space and
time are frequent; for, as already indicated,
whatever letters or other documents there
may have been have long ago disappeared,
and we have little more than knowledge of
extended residence at certain important
points, Hamburg, Cologne, Worms, and
shorter visits to the Wartburg, Wittenberg,
Antwerp, etc. As Froude aptly says: "His
history is the history of his work, and his
epitaph is the Reformation."</p>

<p>It was in Worms that the famous diet had
been held at which Luther braved the Empire
in its assembled might, and here it is that
Rietschel's monument to the Reformation
stands in bronze and granite.  Colossal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
figures, Waldo and Wyclif, Huss and Savonarola,
have towering above them the figure of
Luther, his right hand clenched and resting
on the Bible. Bas-reliefs and medallions
carry select details. Where selection was
imperative, there could not fail to be regrettable
omissions; but one misses also forces
that were vital. Gutenberg is not there; nor
any symbol of his craft.</p>

<p>Without the service rendered by the printing
press of recent invention, it is almost inconceivable
that there could have been any
such world-shaking event as the Reformation
proved. Not only was the burning eloquence
of the preacher carried by this means far
and wide, but the Scriptures themselves in
the language of the people were thrown off
from scores of presses in the Rhine Valley
and dispersed to many lands. Like wildfire
knowledge ran.</p>

<p>Gutenberg, and Fust with Schoeffer in
Maintz, Quentel and Bryckmann in Cologne,
were the names most frequent on the title
pages of the Bible; and their fame has
proved enduring.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
In the early decades of the Sixteenth
Century, even in Germany printing was still
regarded as one of the marvels of the time.
But in England, the first quarter of the
century had just ended when the authorities
took alarm at its power and sought to curb it.
They instituted a censorship to kill it. Its
development was persistently thwarted for
many years.</p>

<p>Well did Tindale understand that the English
government not merely forbade the
translation of the Bible into the native
tongue, but were trying to strangle the printing
craft in its infancy.</p>

<p>Out of England the trade was prospering
at many centres.</p>

<p>He landed at Hamburg. Even then the
city was a busy commercial centre with
business and shipping interests linking it
with every part of the commercial world.
Among the inhabitants were men who welcomed
Tindale and who gave him assistance
in various ways. But he was soon aware
that for his work one essential was lacking.
Not a single printing press had been set up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
in Hamburg as yet. His acquaintance with
Hamburg, however, was of enduring value.
The friends he made there he retained,
and later visits were a solace and encouragement
in days when friends were friends
indeed.</p>

<p>He proceeded to Cologne, where there was
every facility for printing. He had the first
parts of the New Testament in 4to. ready for
the press. Enemies, however, were around and
alert. Circumspection and secrecy were
essential. The work progressed. The printer
had got as far as the first ten sheets when a
restless and resolute enemy, Cochlaeus, having
ferreted the secret from one of the workmen
in his cups, obtained authority to put a
stop to the work. Tindale managed to secure
his property and left the city. He escaped
up the Rhine to safety in the city of Worms;
where reformation was in power, and where
he could continue his work with new feelings
of security.</p>

<p>Here, then, he lost no time in resuming his
work.</p>

<div class="image-center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
  <img src="images/064.jpg" width="452" height="750" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">

  </div>
</div>

<p>He found a sympathetic printer in P. Schoeffer.
Tindale appears to have rearranged
his plans. Possibly he had ascertained
that Cochlaeus, balked of victory at the
very last, had with vindictive cunning sent
letters to England giving full particulars of
the kind of volume that was in the making:
(It was to be a 4to. with notes and comments)
and urging the authorities to guard
against its being smuggled into the country.
Tindale forestalled that enemy. It was not
a 4to. volume which he now designed at
Worms, but an 8vo. volume; and this had
neither note nor gloss. It would seem that
alongside of this, but at more leisurely pace,
the 4to. also was completed, very likely in the
same printing house. Both volumes bear the
stamp of the same year of issue, 1525.
The two editions were successfully conveyed
to England; so that the immediate
effect of the attack was to issue two
editions instead of one—6,000 volumes
instead of 3,000. A skilful system of
Colportage carried these books all over
England. Before the books arrived, the
King had a second warning. Edward Lee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
afterwards Archbishop of York, was then on
the Continent, and dating his letter from
Bordeaux, December 2nd, 1525, he says:
"Please it Your Highness to understand that
I am certainly informed as I passed in this
country that an Englishman, your subject, at
the solicitation and instance of Luther with
whom he is, hath translated the New Testament
into English, and within a few days
intendeth to arrive with the same imprinted
in England. I need not to advertize Your
Grace what infection and danger may ensue
hereby if he be not withstanded. This is the
next way to fulfil your realm with Lutherians."
Then he adds: "All our forefathers,
Governors of the Church of England, hath
with all diligence, forbid and eschewed
publication of English Bibles, as appeareth
in Constitutions Provincial of the Church of
England."</p>

<p>The news had travelled far before reaching
Lee, and was inaccurate at that: but the
swiftness with which it reached him was
proof of the excitement which Cochlaeus' discovery
had created.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
More interesting and more accurate is a
notice which occurs in the diary of a German
scholar,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span> some four months earlier in time.
He says: "One told us at the dinner table that
6,000 copies of the English Testament had
been printed at Worms: that it was translated
by an Englishman who lived there with
two of his countrymen. He was so complete
a master of seven languages—Hebrew,
Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, English and
French—that you would fancy whichever one
he spoke was his mother tongue." He adds
that the English, in spite of the opposition of
the King, were so eager for the Gospel, as to
affirm they would buy a New Testament even
if they had to give a hundred thousand pieces
of money for it.</p>

<p>While the enemy raged, the presses abroad
were not idle. Additional editions were
printed to take the place of those destroyed.
They were conveyed with the same success to
English ports. In less than five years six
editions had been published, three of them
surreptitiously. They numbered perhaps
fifteen thousand copies in all, and were distributed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
to eager purchasers by the same
formidable organization of colportage.</p>

<p>Nor was Tindale idle. He had foreseen
the tactics of his foes. He kept steadfastly
at work. He revised his translation of the
New Testament, and he proceeded to turn the
Old Testament into the English speech; the
Pentateuch, the historical books as far as
Chronicles, the book of Jonah he completed.
In 1536 he was able to send the manuscript
of his revised New Testament to England,
and there it was put upon the press. That
was the first volume of Holy Scripture to be
printed on English soil.</p>

<p>It was, however, the closing year of Tindale's
life. Before the book came off the
press he may have sealed his testimony; but
at least he would be cheered by tidings of its
progress, and the knowledge that the work
had found its proper home in his own land.
"For this end", says Westcott, "he had
constantly striven; for this he had been prepared
to sacrifice everything else; and the
end was gained only when he was called to
die."</p>

    <p>PAGE FROM TINDALE'S 1536 REVISED NEW TESTAMENT.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
Some time elapsed before the discovery of
the contraband Testament was made by the
ecclesiastical authorities, who then instituted
a search so bitterly persistent and so pervasive
in its continuance, that, of these
editions, there survive in our time only a
couple of 8vo. copies, one of these incomplete;
and only a fragmentary copy of the 4to.
The eventual destruction, however, did not
prevent the Testament meanwhile having its
own influence and bringing comfort and hope
to thousands of English homes.</p>

<p>Not only so,—and this is the tribute that
is due to Tindale's translation,—the translation
as Tindale made it is in substance and
form the English New Testament as we have
it to-day. Notwithstanding the numberless
revisions that have taken place, it is substantially
Tindale's translation still; for the
revisers have always, unconsciously perhaps,
done their revising in the spirit and manner
of Tindale. Of all that have worked upon the
English Bible, no other single man has left
his mark on this book; the version in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
hands to-day bears the unmistakable stamp
of its first translator.</p>

<p>"The peculiar genius—if such a word may
be permitted—which breathes through it—the
mingled tenderness and majesty—the
Saxon simplicity—the preternatural grandeur—unequalled,
unapproached, in the attempted
improvements of modern scholars,—all
are here, and bear the impress of the mind
of one man—William Tindale. Lying, while
engaged in that great office, under the
shadow of death, the sword above his head
and ready at any moment to fall, he worked,
under circumstances alone perhaps truly
worthy of the task which was laid upon him,—his
spirit, as it were divorced from the
world, moved in a purer element than common
air."</p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right1">(<i>Froude, Henry Eighth, Vol. II</i>).</div>
</div>

<p>The contents of this book as it passed into
the hands of the nation, printed not in the
language of the court, nor in that of either
the statesman or the scholar, but in the
language of the common people, finding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
them, as it did, more especially at critical
times when events seemed to be threatening
the overthrow of the nation as much as of the
individual, stole into the imagination of the
people, and by degrees gave form and life to
those great virtues, justice, freedom, truth,
tolerance and self-sacrifice, which have become
the vivid traditions that govern in the
main the English-speaking people. Here was
the fountain head from which the main
stream of their literature, legislation, public
policy, and national character derives its flow
and power.</p>

<p>For it is admitted that the distinction of
this great people from other nations in a
certain generosity, patience, integrity and
courage, rests remotely on their silent appropriation
of the vital forces released in this
book of God.</p>

<p>Such far-reaching consequences afford the
best measure of the immense significance—much
greater than he could foresee—of Tindale's
toil that he might open the eyes of
England to the message he succeeded in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
turning into imperishable language under-standed
of the people.</p>

<p>No phase of Tindale's work intrigues the
student so much as his perfect command of
his native tongue. Where and how did he
acquire this mastery of pure sonorous English,
whose rhythmic prose is like stately
music to the most cultured ear? Study of the
Vulgate and of the originals he worked on has
not indeed to be overlooked as a possible
source; but there is a gift, native-born, or
acquired in secret toil, which, with those
tides of devout feeling we find swelling in
the man himself, stamps the style as the
organ utterance of his consecrated manhood.</p>

<p>Tindale's rendering of 1 Cor. 13, with the
parallels for comparison of Wyclif and the
Authorized Version of 1611, illustrates both
the style of the great translator and the
permanence of his translation in the version
current for four hundred years.</p>

<h3><span class="smc">Wyclif</span>—1380</h3>

<h3><span class="smc">Tyndale</span>—1536</h3>

<p>Though I spake with the tonges of men
and angels, and yet had no love, I were even
as soundings brasse: or as a tynklynge
Cymball. And though I coulde prophesy,
and vnderstode all secretes, and all knowledge:
yee, yf I had all fayth so that I coulde
move mountayns oute of ther places, and yet
had no love, I were nothynge. And though I
bestowed all my gooddes to fede the poore,
and though I gave my body even that I
burned, and yet had no love, it profeteth me
nothinge. Love suffreth longe, and is
cirteous. Love envieth not. Love doth nor
frowardly, swelleth not dealeth not dishonestly,
seeketh not her awne is not provoked
to anger, thynketh not evyll, reioyseth
not in iniquite: but reioyseth in the trueth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
suffreth all thynge, beleveth all thynges,
hopeth all thynges, endureth in all thynges.
Though that prophesyinge fayle, other
tonges shall cease, or knowledge vanysshe
awaye, yet love falleth never awaye.</p>

<p>For oure knowledge is vnparfect, and oure
prophesyinge is vnperfect. But when that
which is parfect is come, than that which is
vnparfect shall be done awaye.</p>

<p>When I was a chylde, I spake as a chylde, I
vnderstode as a chylde I ymagened as a
chylde. But assone as I was a man, I put
awaye childesshnes. Now we se in a glasse
even in a darke speakynge: but then shall
we se face to face. Now I knowe unparfectly:
but then shall I knowe even as I am knowen.
Now abideth fayth, hope, and love, even these
thre: but the chief of these is love.</p>

<h3><span class="smc">Authorized</span>—1611</h3>

<p>Though I speake with the tongues of men
and of Angels, and haue not charity, I am
become as sounding brasse or a tinkling
cymbal. And though I haue the gift of
prophesie, and vnderstand all mysteries and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
all knowledge: and though I haue all faith, so
that I could remooue mountains, and haue no
charitie, I am nothing. And though I bestowe
all my goods to feede the poore, and though
I giue my body to bee burned, and haue not
charitie, it profiteth me nothing. Charitie
suffereth long, and is kinde: charitie enuieth
not: charitie vaunteth not it selfe, is not
puffed vp, Doeth not behaue it selfe unseemly,
seeketh not her owne, is not easily
prouoked, thinketh no euill, Reioyceth not
in iniquitie, but reioyceth in the trueth:
Beareth all things, beleeueth all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all things.
Charitie neuer faileth: but whether there be
prophesies, they shall faile; whether there
bee tongues, they shall cease; whether there
bee knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we
know in part, and we prophesie in part. But
when that which is perfect is come, then that
which is in part, shall be done away. When I
was a childe, I spake as a childe, I vnderstood
as a childe, I thought as a childe: but when I
became a man, I put away childish things.
For now we see through a glasse darkely: but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
then face to face: now I know in part, but
then shall I know euen as also I am knowen.
And now abideth faith, hope, charitie, these
three, but the greatest of these is charitie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
PERSONALITY</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE have cited the happy epigram of
the historian that Tindale's work is
his history and his epitaph is the
Reformation. This is just and felicitous.
When he seeks a telling phrase to set forth
the personality of Tindale, however, he is not
happy.</p>

<p>He calls him "a young dreamer". As if
he were dissatisfied with this, he calls him
elsewhere "a fiery young enthusiast." The
second is no truer than the first.</p>

<p>Tindale had the dream of England's greatness
if her people had the Bible in their
mother tongue: and to use his own words,
"he encountered poverty, exile, bitter absence
from friends, hunger, thirst and cold, great
dangers and innumerable, hard and sharp
fightings, to make his dream come true."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
But "dreamer" is not the word for a life
like that.</p>

<p>"Enthusiasm and fire", yes, these undoubtedly
Tindale possessed. When copies
of Tindale's Testament were bought and
burnt in Antwerp, London and Oxford, his
remark was: "They did none other than that
I looked for; no more shall they do if they
burned me also. If it be God's will it shall so
be."</p>

<p>At one of the burnings, Fisher, Bishop of
Rochester, preached against Luther. Tidings
of the scene having reached Tindale, he wrote
some time afterwards: "Mark, I pray you,
what an orator he is, and how vehemently he
persuadeth it. Martin Luther burnt the
Pope's decretals; 'a manifest sign', saith he
(Fisher) that he would have burned the
Pope's Holiness also if he had had him.</p>

<p>A like argument which I suppose to be
rather true, I (Tindale) make: The Pope
and his holy brethren have burned Christ's
Testament: an evident sign verily that they
would have burnt Christ Himself if they had
had Him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
But this vehemency was only part of the
man. The whole man kept these inner fires
aglow year after year until he had finished
the work assigned to him. Even by an adversary
he was called "a learned, pious,
good man": his keeper, and his keeper's
daughter, and others of his keeper's household
were won over by him to his belief.</p>

<p>His was a personality rich and brave,
capable of great endurance because aglow
with zeal that many waters could not quench,
vehement indeed against the enemy, yet a
very perfect knight; with a sympathy and
tenderness and faith that brought him the
trust and affectionate esteem of those who
came to know the man himself.</p>

</div>

<p>No, neither "dreamer" nor "enthusiast"
holds the mirror up to this man. He was
both dreamer and enthusiast, and a great
deal besides. He was a man who loved. He
deliberately gave his life to the accomplishing
of one great task. He sacrificed everything
to that. That nobleness of purpose,
that fortitude in toil, that undeviating devotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
to his single aim until he triumphed,
call for some ampler phrase in bronze:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
CONCLUSION</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON issuing his translation, and again
when sending forth his translation revised,
Tindale solicited the aid of
scholars in amending his version wherever
they could. This was not a mere fashion of
speech. It was the expression of his sincerity
and his modesty. This one thing he desired,
as he cared for nothing else, that the Bible
in English be as perfect as possible.</p>

<p>Succeeding generations of scholars responded
to his invitation; in a spirit like his
they labored. The Bibles of Coverdale, Matthews,
the Bishops; the Geneva Version and
the Authorized Version, are mile-stones by
the way—evidence with what ardor the
work of revising and perfecting the English
version was carried on age by age.</p>

<div class="image-center">

  </div>
</div>

<p>To find on the one hand this devotion in
rendering the Bible into English, it is most
strange on the other to find the larger vision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
completely disappear, the larger vision of
Erasmus that it should be rendered into
every language. It is as if no such ideal had
been conceived.</p>

<p>Now, three hundred years had to pass by
before we find it being recovered, or before
men were moved with any degree of sympathy
for the ideal which the Dutch scholar
had so bravely ventured to describe.</p>

<p>The universal destiny of the book had
stirred his heart and fired his imagination:
but not until the Evangelical Revival had
deeply moved the people of England, and the
modern Missionary Movement had come in
its train did any men catch the vision of the
Bible for every nation in the native speech.</p>

<p>"With the vision came the power". A
group of men, God-fearing and very courageous,
resolved to enter upon this vast
enterprise, and thus in 1804 was born the
British and Foreign Bible Society.</p>

<p>The undertaking was greater than they
could foresee. It was decried as chimerical;
but month by month, year by year, they pursued
their high purpose: their successors continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
it, and now, 1925, when a hundred and
twenty-one years have sped, the Society has
published or has had in circulation the
Scriptures translated into five hundred and
seventy distinct languages.</p>

<p>Moreover in other lands the establishment
of independent Bible Societies was encouraged.
In the United States of America, soon
after the formation of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, in 1816, the American
Bible Society was established. Noble service
has been rendered by it. It has aided in the
translation and circulation of the Scriptures
in 175 languages; some of which are included
in the total, 570, given above.</p>

<p>Translation seldom fails to exact great
sacrifice. Often life itself succumbs. The
roll of honor is a long one, nearly every
language taking its toll in one form or another.
Tindale's was the first English
sacrifice.</p>

<p>But the end, is it not worthy even at so
great a price? To spell out, in the tongue
they understand, to those sitting in the land
of the shadow of death the tidings of Truth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
and Grace; to set men free in the liberty of
Christ; and to widen the bounds of His
kingdom so that all nations may become His
inheritance—what mission can be named so
worthy of the uttermost devotion?</p>

<p>Much remains to be done; but if the morale
of these men awaken admiration in us and we
share their faith, great as is the undertaking
that remains, it will be overtaken in
the good providence of God.</p>
